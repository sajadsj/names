# names

In a file called names.txt, you are given 20 names, each with a maximum length of 32 characters and a name in each row of the file. Your application should read this file and answer the following questions. (Each question must be answered in the form of a function)
1- Duplicate names and their number
2- Take a string from the user and print the names that contain that string
3- Check that there is a name that is a subset of another name (such as amir and amirsalar) and print both
4- Arrange the names in alphabetical order and print them on the page
